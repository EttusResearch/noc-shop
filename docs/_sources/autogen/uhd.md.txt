## RFNoC Blocks


- **DRAM FIFO**: A large FIFO block that uses a device's DRAM.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Null Source/Sink**: The Null Source/Sink acts as a streaming endpoint, consuming all the incoming
data, or a data generator. It is typically used for testing and debugging
purposes.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Split Stream**: The split stream block is used to duplicate data in RFNoC flow graphs.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Digital Downconverter**: This block combines an integer resampler (decimator) with a frequency
shifter. It is often used directly after the radio block of a USRP to adapt
center frequency (e.g., to provide an LO offset) and sampling rate.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Vector IIR (Average)**: The Vector IIR Block is an RFNoC block that implements an infinite
impulse filter with a variable length delay line. It is useful for averaging
consecutive power density values.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **License Checker**: This block is used to read and evaluate license keys. It is used in combination
with RFNoC blocks that require such keys.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Add/Subtract**: This block provides the sum and difference of two input channels. It also
provides different types of implementations as an example.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Log Power**: The Log Power Block is an RFNoC block that takes in a packet of signed
16-bit complex samples and computes an estimate of 1024 * log2(i^2 + q^2),
putting the result in the upper 16 bits of each 32-bit output sample.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Switchboard**: This is a programmable router block that routes any single input to any
single output. Routing is 1 to 1, that is, an input port can only be connected
to one output port, and vice versa.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **FIR Filter**: A programmable FIR filter block. The filter taps can be exchanged at runtime.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **RFNoC Fosphor (F15) Block.**: This block takes input from an FFT block and produces data for a histogram
and waterfall. It should be combined with a graphical widget that displays
the data correctly.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Window Function**: The Window Block is a windowing block for RFNoC that is intended to be
used with the FFT block. The block can be configured with coefficients,
by which the samples in each input packet are multiplied before begin
output. The first sample of the first packet is multiplied by the first
first coefficient, the second sample is multiplied by the second
coefficient, and so on.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **FFT**: An FFT implementation that provides forward and inverse FFT, cyclic prefix
insertion and removal, variable FFT sizes and different output formats.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Keep-One-In-N-Block**: This block is a decimator block which either drops packets or individual samples,
keeping one item out of every N, where N is a runtime-configurable value.
This block can be useful after a vector-average block.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Moving Average**: The Moving Average block is an RFNoC block that computes the running average
of an input data stream.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Radio**: The radio-block is a hardware-dependent block which exposes access to a
streaming engine as well as to the underlying hardware.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **DRAM Replay/Capture**: This block is used to capture data into DRAM and play it back from there.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Signal Generator**: The signal generator block can be used to produce signals of various types.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


- **Digital Upconverter**: This block combines an integer resampler (interpolator) with a frequency
shifter. It is often used directly after the radio block of a USRP to adapt
center frequency (e.g., to provide an LO offset) and sampling rate.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3


### RFNoC Modules


- **Device DNA Module**: Exposes the FPGA's device DNA as a data bus.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3

### RFNoC Transport Adapters


- **CHDR DMA**: The DMA transport adapter directly connects the PL to the PS. The DMA engine
itself is not part of the image core (it is always instantiated), so this
transport adapter is mostly a passthrough.

  - Software License: GPLv3
  - HDL License: LGPLv3

- **USRP X4xx Ethernet Transport Adapter**: The USRP X4xx devices must specify transport adapters explicitly for
connectivity. This is the transport adapter for 10 and 100 GbE Ethernet.

  - HDL License: LGPLv3
